<h1> DEVELOPMENT </h1>

<h2> WEEK ONE </h2>
During Week One, I wrote my proposal. I also had to make some changes to my initial proposal. I initially planned on using ofxASR
as my Speech Recognition library, but ofxASR proved to be an archaic library that was difficult to use. As a result, I alternatively
decided to use Microsoft's Speech-to-text REST API in order to recognize speech, then use ofxJSON to parse the result.
