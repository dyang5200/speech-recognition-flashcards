<h1> Project Proposal </h1>

<h3> Project: </h3>
My project idea is to create a flashcard-based language learning tool -- specifically speaking (ie: pronunciation) -- using speech recognition. I plan on having a single window that displays one flashcard at a time. Each flashcard will display a single word or sentence. The user will then attempt to speak the word/sentence on the flashcard. If the user pronounces it correctly, the app will move onto the next flashcard. If the user pronounces it incorrectly, the app will say it's incorrect.

<h4> Possible Extensions: </h4>

* Implement a tool that speaks the word/sentence back to the user with correct pronounciation

* Implement more flashcard utilities (ie: Create an "incorrect" pile and have the user loop through those again)

* Make the flashcard UI more clean and user-friendly with a [flashcard library](https://github.com/BlackJar72/QFlashCards?fbclid=IwAR3MQUMDM4q78hIF_tv_X3u-XGz-sicOG-TCrtDdpFlzK_jFgzm0bkU0lIg)

<h4> Libraries: </h4>

* I will use OpenFrameworks to create a windows application (the UI) for this project. More specifically, I will use the OpenFrameworks
[Graphics Library](https://openframeworks.cc/documentation/graphics/) to create the flashcards.
* [Speech Recognition oF Add-On](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/ofxASR)
