Project Proposal

Project:
My project idea is to create a flashcard-based language learning tool -- specifically speaking (ie: pronunciation) -- using speech recognition. I plan on having a single window that displays one flashcard at a time. Each flashcard will display a single word or sentence. The user will then attempt to speak the word/sentence on the flashcard. If the user pronounces it correctly, the app will move onto the next flashcard. If the user pronounces it incorrectly, the app will say it's incorrect.

Possible Extensions:
- Implement a tool that speaks the word/sentence back to the user with correct pronounciation
- Implement more flashcard utilities (ie: Create an "incorrect" pile and have the user loop through those again)
- Make the flashcard UI more clean and user-friendly.

Libraries:
I will use OpenFrameworks to create a windows application (the UI) for this project. More specifically, I will use the OpenFrameworks Graphics Library to create the flashcards.
