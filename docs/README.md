# Speech Recognition Flashcards

Speech Recognition Flashcards is an openFrameworks desktop application that allows users to input a list of English words and practice pronuncing them. If the user pronounces a word incorrectly, the program will speak the word back to the user with the correct pronunciation.

This application currently only works with English words (learning English).
